<br/><br/>

## Prerequisites

The analyses are built upon [`Snakemake`](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) pipelines which are used to process raw sequencing reads on a computing cluster with a `slurm` workload manager. `Snakemake` can be installed using [`miniconda`](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/main) given the provided conda environment (`envs/snakemake_conda_env.yaml`). Subsequent analyses are mainly written using `Python` (version 3.12; see provided conda environment `envs/analysis_conda_env.yaml`) with some parts done in `R` (version 4.4.0; see required library versions `envs/R_library_versions.txt`). Prior to execution of any script, make sure the correct paths are provided and the input is in the correct format.

The raw sequencing reads generated within this study are available on the ENA BioProject [PRJEB98220](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB98220) and the Biosample IDs of utilized public data are available within `metadata/public_data/Pub_data_biosampleid_list.txt`. All sequencing data should be downloaded using e.g. `nf-core/fetchngs` or `fasterq-dump` prior to analysis.

<br/><br/>

## Species-specific analyses

The first part of the analysis processes raw sequencing reads on a computing cluster using `Snakemake` pipelines with published bioinformatic tools, classifies the taxonomy of every sample, aligns the quality-controlled reads against a reference genome, calls single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and proccesses those with related summary metrics into a multi-dimensional matrix. The second part can be performed on a local machine. It filters samples and SNVs based on which the fine-grained evolutionary analysis can be performed.

### Species-specific raw data processing

Prerequisites: 
- Download of sequencing reads [PRJEB98220](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB98220)
- Installation of the `Snakemake` conda environment (`envs/snakemake_conda_env.yaml`)
- Access to a computing cluster with `slurm` workload manager

Raw data processing is implemented to be conducted on a computing cluster (see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)) using multiple `Snakemake` pipelines. 

1. `raw_data_processing/kraken2`: Taxonomic classification to estimate the abundance of reads of the focal species within each sample, sequence typing & *de novo* genome assemblies of each individual sample.
    - prior to run the pipeline, a database for kraken and bracken need to be built
    - to run the samples on the data, use `raw_data_processing/kraken2/HAI_samples.csv`
2. `raw_data_processing/species_specific/mapping`: Alignment of quality-filtered reads against a reference genome
3. `raw_data_processing/species_specific/case`: Generation of a multi-dimensional matrix (`candidate_mutation_table.pickle.gz`) for each reference genome containing candidate SNVs and respective summary metrics

Further information can be found [here](raw_data_processing/). 

### Species-specific SNV-based analysis

Prerequisites: 
- Species-specific raw data processing (required output file: `candidate_mutation_table.pickle.gz`, `cov_raw_sparsecsr_mat.npz`)
- Installation of the analysis conda environment (`envs/analysis_conda_env.yaml`)

Following the raw data processing, the species-specific evolutionary analysis (`local_analysis/species_specific_analysis/SNV_analysis/hap2020_analysispy_refbased_v3.py`) utilizes the output from the raw data processing (`candidate_mutation_table.pickle.gz`) to generate pathogen-patient pair specific maximum likelihood phylogenies to identify lineage clusters.

Further information can be found [here](local_analysis/species_specific_analysis/). 

<br/><br/>

## Lineage-specific analyses 

After identification of lineage clusters, quality-filtered sequencing reads are utilized on a computing cluster using `Snakemake` pipelines to assemble *de novo* lineage-specific genomes against which the reads are aligned and obtained single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels are processed with related summary metrics into a multi-dimensional matrix, while coverage matrices are generated for mobile genetic element (MGE) identification. The subsequent analyses are designed to run on a local machine and filter samples and candidate SNVs and indels and identifies MGEs.

### Lineage-specific raw data processing

- Download of sequencing reads [PRJEB98220](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB98220)
- Installation of the `Snakemake` conda environment (`envs/snakemake_conda_env.yaml`)
- Access to a computing cluster with `slurm` workload manager
- Samples clustered to distinct lineages based on the identified lineage cutoff and the phylogenies from the species-specific analysis (`raw_data_processing/lineage_specific/assembly/sample_lineage_files`)

0. `raw_data_processing/kraken2`: (required from [Species-specific analysis](#species-specific-analyses))
1. `raw_data_processing/lineage_specific/assembly`: Assembly of lineage-specific *de novo* genomes
    - based on the reconstructed phylogenies and the taxonomic classification from the species-specific analysis, high-quality samples of each lineage need to be provided (see `raw_data_processing/lineage_specific/assembly/sample_lineage_files`)
2. `raw_data_processing/lineage_specific/mapping`: Alignment of quality-filtered reads against the respective *de novo* assembled lineage-specific genome
3. `raw_data_processing/lineage_specific/case`: Generation of a multi-dimensional matrix for each *de novo* assembled lineage-specific genome containing candidate SNVs, indels and respective summary metrics for each variant and two coverage matrices
